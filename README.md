ProjectSWG is the first NGE emulator for Star Wars Galaxies founded on
July 7th, 2011 after SOE announced the official shutdown of Star Wars Galaxies.
Our goal is to create an emulator which will provide a server for players to
continue playing a game similar to the one they used to play. We are basing
it on the final publish of the game prior to end-game events.

2. Setup a postgresql server, preferably on localhost, with a database and user named nge with read/write permissions.
    * Note: You will need to restore the database that you created using nge.backup in order to create the proper tables.
