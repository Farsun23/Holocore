 * ProjectSWG is the first NGE emulator for Star Wars Galaxies founded on           *
 * July 7th, 2011 after SOE announced the official shutdown of Star Wars Galaxies.  *
 * Our goal is to create an emulator which will provide a server for players to     *
 * continue playing a game similar to the one they used to play. We are basing      *
 * it on the final publish of the game prior to end-game events.                    *
 *                                                                                  *
