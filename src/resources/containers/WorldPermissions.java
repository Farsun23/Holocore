 * Our goal is to create an emulator which will provide a server for players to
 * continue playing a game similar to the one they used to play. We are basing
 * it on the final publish of the game prior to end-game events.

/**
 * This is essentially a universal "all-in-one" permission set for managing permission groups for world objects. This
 * class makes use of permission groups. Every player joins the world permission group upon creation. When a specific
 * group is needed, the object will have to remove the world permission set and replace it with their own group of
 * permissions.
 * <br><br>Example: In order to allow only certain players into an area of Jabba's palace, you would first
 * create a permission group for the CellObject with a unique name. Then you need to add the named group to the
 * players ContainerPermissions joinedGroups list in order for them to properly pass the checks.
 * <br><br>
 * This set of permissions will allow:
 * <OL>
 * <LI>View - If the viewer has joined a group that is recognized by the container with viewing permissions</LI>
 * <LI>Enter - If the viewer has joined a group that is recognized by the container with enter permissions</LI>
 * <LI>Remove, Move, Add - If the container has the same owner as the requester</LI>
 * </OL>
